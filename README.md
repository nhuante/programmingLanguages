#### Introduction 
This report was made for my personal reflections on the Fall 2023 Programming Languages course, taught by Professor Alexander Kurz. It includes all of our homework assignment, along with my thoughts or my process for completing them, my thoughts on the project I developed and a few extra details. For all of the homework assignments, my goal was to review the concepts we learned in lecture and explain them in my own understanding as well as how they relate to the assignment. My goal was to not only include the technical answers but also explain my thinking in finding the solution. 


My project was developed throughout the entirety of the semester and by a team of three (myself, Kyle, and Lauren). [You can see the repository for the project here.](https://github.com/KyleWynne/Health_Blocks) This project was made in the effort to create a more accessible and intuitive method for users to access a nutritional database without the need for previous experience using an API. We used both the Nutritionix API's database and natural language processing model alongside the Blockly API in order to create our final product. For anyone interested, the project's repository gives a much more detailed description and explanation behind its implementation. 


This document was developed in LaTeX and, along with the Health Blocks project,  makes up the bulk of the coursework for the class. Lastly, this report is not merely an accumulation of the work from the semester, but rather a more polished version of what I have learned from each lecture and assignment as well as from the course as a whole.
